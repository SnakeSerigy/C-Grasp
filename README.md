# C-Grasp

This is a library with the continuous grasp metaheuristic coded for the Optimization discipline at UFPE.

It is adapted for minimization problems with box constrains.

If you wish to test it or use it, I recommend the c++ version for better speed.

To use it, set the boundaries and the function as shown in the sample files and run it according to the makefile command:

````
make compile target=<name of the file>
````
